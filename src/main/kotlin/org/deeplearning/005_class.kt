/*
A class in Kotlin can have a primary constructor and one or more secondary constructors. The primary constructor is part of the class header: it goes after the class name (and optional type parameters)
If the primary constructor does not have any annotations or visibility modifiers, the constructor keyword can be omitted

/*
In fact, for declaring properties and initializing them from the primary constructor, Kotlin has a concise syntax:
Much the same way as regular properties, the properties declared in the primary constructor can be mutable (var) or read-only (val).
If the constructor has annotations or visibility modifiers, the constructor keyword is required, and the modifiers go before it

/*
If a non-abstract class does not declare any constructors (primary or secondary), it will have a generated primary constructor with no arguments. The visibility of the constructor will be public.

/*
On the JVM, if all of the parameters of the primary constructor have default values, the compiler will generate an additional parameterless constructor which will use the default values. This makes it easier to use Kotlin with libraries such as Jackson or JPA that create class instances through parameterless constructors.
